\label{Conclusion}

While a streaming algorithm as Misra-Gries provides the advantage of less memory usage, it has one key disadvantage for our problem - the need to explore every possible triplet combination. In cases where the actors count of a movie is too big (1000+), this introduces an unacceptable running time. Our approach goes away with this by managing to explore a triplet only once. Furthermore, it allows for parallelisation of the computation by allowing subsets of the data to be computed independently.


\subsection{Future Work}
Possible future work might be exploring counting triangles algorithm. We can build graph in the same way we presented, but we analyze each triangle in the graph instead (a triangle represents a triplet of actors). Counting triangles method using MapReduce gives good results and might be an interesting alternative to our approach \footnote{http://theory.stanford.edu/~sergei/papers/www11-triangles.pdf}.
