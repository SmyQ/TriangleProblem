\section{Conclusion}

While a streaming algorithm as Misra-Gries provides the advantage of less memory usage, it has one key disadvantage for our problem - the need to explore every possible triplet combination. In cases where the actors count of a movie is too big (1000+), this introduces an unacceptable running time. Our approach goes away with this by managing to explore a triplet only once. Furthermore, it allows for parallelisation of the computation by allowing subsets of the data to be computed independently.
