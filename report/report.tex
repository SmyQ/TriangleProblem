\begin{abstract}

Large data is difficult to process. The main difficulty comes from the fact it is not possible to store the data in its entirety in memory and directly manipulate it. A number of algorithms, each of them with its own strategy, are designed for working around this problem. One such strategy is splitting the data into bits that can be computed independently. Alternatively, another strategy offers an approximation of the result with the advantage of using little memory. In this paper we explore two such algorithms, comparing their running times and space usage. The first algorithm, designed by us, is specifically targeted for solving the problem at hand. This makes it possible to apply some seemingly small tweaks, which increase performance dramatically. The second is the Misra-Gries streaming algorithm. Furthermore, the concept of parallelism is explored in the context of our solution. It is shown that with very little additional code the sequential algorithm can be easily parallelised.
