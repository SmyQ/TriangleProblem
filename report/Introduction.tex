\section{Introduction}

The IMDB dataset provides data about actors, movies and relations between them. Based on this dataset a number of interesting properties can be extracted from the data. The point, however, is doing this in efficient manner.

In section \ref{sec:ProblemDescription} we examine the problem, its input and expected output. In section \ref{MisraGries} we look at a standard approach for solving the problem - using the well known Misra-Gries streaming algorithm. We present the running time and space usage for various input sizes. In the next section we turn our attention to our algorithm that improves on many of shortcomings of Misra-Gries. Further. Section \ref{Parallelism} explores a way of improving our algorithm running time by running it in parallel. In section \ref{Experiments}, we compare the two approaches, their running time, space usage, how they differ and why.
