\section{Experiments}


Some experiments were conducted to verify the correctness of the algorithm and its running time. The results were compared with the "naive" approach - a brute force algorithm that checks any possible combinatiions. As expected, this naive algorithm runs considerably slower. The experiments results can be seen in the table below.

\begin{tabular}{l*{6}{c}r}
               & X Actors, Y Movies & XX Actors, YY Movies & XXX Actors, YYY Movies \\
\hline
Naive Approach & X Seconds & XX seconds & XXX seconds\\
Our Approach   & Y Seconds & YY seconds & YYY seconds\\
\end{tabular}
The running times of our approach match the predictions made in previous section.
