\section{Standard approach}

We firstly started with implementing data streaming technique. Since our goal is to find heavy hitters, we chose Misra-Gries algorithm to save space and to process fast large amount fo data.

\label{MisraGries}
\subsection{Pseudocode}
The idea of the algorithm is to process data movie by movie. Each movie has a list of actors and while processing them we create triplets for each movie. Then we simply count triplets by adding them to the cache table.
\\
Let m denote number of movies..

\begin{verbatim}
Algorithm 1: MisraGries()
2	{a1,a2,a3};
3	FOREACH movie DO
4	  FOR i ← 0 to size of A(movie) DO
7	      FOR j ← i + 1 to size of A(movie) DO
5		  FOR k ← j + 1 to size of A(movie) DO	          
16	      END FOR
17	    END IF
18	  END FOR
19	END FOREACH
20	RETURN moviesCount, {a1,a2,a3};	  	                    	  
\end{verbatim}
